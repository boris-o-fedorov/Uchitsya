This my project for my year 13 A level Computer Science project.

It is a simple web-based school system using PHP for server-side programming as well 
as HTML, CSS and Java script where users can register, login make classrooms, join classrooms, go to 
their classrooms and write stuff in the classroom.

The documentation was to big to upload as a file so I have attached it here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1amkpr62tK4FcVQ5iItN9i0MeftQ6TGP5/view
